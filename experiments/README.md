## Hardware traces

2017-11-11-experiment01.csv is the first trace under real conditions and has a duration of 8h, it was captured indoor on a rainy day,
with an open window. At the end of the trace, most of the clothes have been dry, the sweatshirt with the sensor attached
to it did not completely dry within the 8 hours (that's why the sensor readings do not reach 0 in the end).

2017-11-14-experiment02.csv - real conditions, indoor, not rainy, window open. The first 3 hours are not included in the trace,
in the end, the clothes have been mostly dry. Some gaps in the data are caused by the tcp wifi transmission protocol, which is
not that stable.

2017-11-20-experiment03.csv - real conditions, indoor, rainy, window open. Starts in the moment the clothes started to dry.

2017-11-25-experiment04.csv - real conditions, indoor, rainy day, from beginning. Includes readings for both sensors.
